<h2>Edisto Sunset</h2>

      <p> Several years ago, I had the opportunity to visit Edisto Island, and it was there that I found the inspiration for my latest piece. While my family and I were staying in a little house with a marsh view, I decided to attend a painting class. The class was doing a tutorial, but I felt that I should create my own unique piece based on the beauty of our surroundings. The result was Edisto Sunset, a painting that captures the magic of the island at dusk.</p>
       <p>

For me, this piece is just a painting, but it is also more than that. This piece of art reminds me of the time I got to spend with my family on that island. It reminds me of the fishing trips with my brothers and the painting I did on my own. It reminds me of the times I went pokemon hunting around the island trying to catch a Pikatchu. This painting represents every time I went to the island, and every small bit of time I spent there. </div>
