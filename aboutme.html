    <h3> <p>This about me section is just to get to know me a little. My name is Emma Williamson and I am a Digital Culture and Design Major at Coastal Carolina University. My focus is in web design, and I am currently pursuing a certificate in geospatial technologies. </p>
      <p>I created this website to showcase the art I have made throughout the years in a digital repository made completely from scratch. I enjoy building websites and making art. I also am a big music fan as well. I enjoy fishing, mostly for catfish, and listening to old country music while doing so. My goal as a DCD major is to learn more about web design and its applications so that I may use it in a career in the future. </p>
      <p> I hope that by getting to know me a little, those who read this and see my website will understand the artworks a little more and see a little more into the meaning of them as well. There may not be enough information to understand the work, but it is enough information to understand the artist behind the work. </p>
